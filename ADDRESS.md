# OPTIONAL Question: üó∫Ô∏è Address

There are a lot of places in our Angular application where we need to ask the user for a physical address such as this one:

*Example Address*

```javascript
123 Main St
New York, NY 18814
```

In order to add an address field to many parts of our application to minimize code duplication, you would:
- Build a reusable address form component
- Possibly use an API or library to help with address validation / autocomplete
- Properly organize address logic/formatting/validation
- Include tests, etc.

## We will use the address control like this

```javascript
export class AppComponent {

	mainForm = new FormGroup({
		accept: new FormControl(), // true; false;
		address: new FormControl()
 	})
    }
}


----app-component.html
<form [formGroup]="mainForm">
    <mat-checkbox [formControlName]="accept"></mat-checkbox>
    <app-address [formControlName]="address"></app-address>
</form>
```

## ü§î‚ÅâÔ∏è Question

How will your component interact with parent form groups? How will it share data with them? Please include detailed information about this.

To make the address component work with parent forms, I'll implement it as a custom form control using ControlValueAccessor. Here's how it works:

1. Component Setup:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-address',
  providers: [
    {
      provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,
      useExisting: forwardRef(() => AddressComponent),
      multi: true
    }
  ]
})
export class AddressComponent implements ControlValueAccessor {
  addressForm = new FormGroup({
    street: new FormControl('', [Validators.required]),
    city: new FormControl('', [Validators.required]),
    state: new FormControl('', [Validators.required]),
    zipCode: new FormControl('', [Validators.required, Validators.pattern(/^\d{5}$/)])
  });

  writeValue(value: any): void {
    if (value) {
      this.addressForm.patchValue(value);
    }
  }

  registerOnChange(fn: any): void {
    this.addressForm.valueChanges.subscribe(fn);
  }

  registerOnTouched(fn: any): void {
    // Handle touch events
  }

  setDisabledState(isDisabled: boolean): void {
    isDisabled ? this.addressForm.disable() : this.addressForm.enable();
  }
}
```

2. Data Flow:
- When the parent form sets a value, it flows down through writeValue()
- When the address form changes, it flows up through valueChanges
- Validation states sync automatically with the parent form

3. Usage in Parent:
```typescript
// Parent component
export class ParentComponent {
  form = new FormGroup({
    address: new FormControl()
  });
}

// Parent template
<form [formGroup]="form">
  <app-address [formControlName]="address"></app-address>
</form>
```

4. Key Points:
- The component maintains its own FormGroup for address fields
- It implements ControlValueAccessor to work with form controls
- Validation is handled internally but exposed to parent
- State changes (dirty, touched, etc.) propagate automatically
- The component can be disabled/enabled from parent form

This approach makes the address component reusable across the application while maintaining proper form integration.
